# Portfolio Project

[View the live page](http://kevinfrutiger.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-portfolio/)

This was the second project in the _Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree_. The objective was to build a web page from a mock-up using Bootstrap's grid system, and use Grunt build tools to generate the responsive image variations.

I made additional adjustments to imagery and colors, inline with project guidelines.
